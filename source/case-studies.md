# Case Studies & Examples

Detailed descriptions of the faculty innovations mentioned in the presentation.

### **Shyam's Assessment Evolution**
**Discipline:** Entrepreneurship (MGMT3004)  
**Faculty:** Shyam (Sam) Cholayil  
**Challenge:** Traditional assessments became AI-completable in minutes  
**Timeline:** Redesigned for Semester 2, 2025

#### **The Problem**

Traditional assignment format:
- **Annotated Bibliography:** Students research 5+ articles per course topic, write 200-word summaries, and connect to course concepts
- **Reality check:** "Could be done in no time using AI"
- Student could input topics → AI finds articles → AI generates summaries → AI makes connections
- Time required: 5-10 minutes
- **Result:** Assessment no longer measured student learning or research skills

#### **The Transformation**

Rather than fighting AI with detection tools, Shyam redesigned the entire unit structure:

**New Assignment 1: Integrated Knowledge Checks**
- Quizzes embedded after each lecture segment and entrepreneur interview
- Tests comprehension and application, not just recall
- Cannot be completed without actually engaging with content
- AI can't substitute for watching videos and making connections

**New Assignment 2: In-Class Collaborative Application**
- Group worksheets with fictitious startup scenarios
- Real problems requiring real-time application of concepts
- Examples: "Your startup has 3 months of cash. Co-founder wants to pivot. Lead investor is nervous. What do you do?"
- Students must:
  - Apply lecture concepts
  - Draw on entrepreneur interview insights
  - Collaborate with teammates
  - Negotiate solutions
  - Defend reasoning under questioning

#### **AI's Role - Supporting Faculty, Not Replacing Students**

Shyam uses AI extensively for instructor efficiency:
- **Generates quiz questions** - AI creates variations, Shyam evaluates and refines
- **Creates startup scenarios** - AI develops diverse, realistic cases for worksheets
- **Produces assessment materials** - Faster content creation = more time for facilitation

**Critical distinction:** AI helps instructor create materials; students' AI use (if any) is for preparation, not completion of assessment.

#### **The Evolution Journey**

**Before 2025:**
- Used AI generically for "ideas on tute execution"
- Traditional assessment structure vulnerable to AI completion

**Semester 2, 2025:**
- Recognized AI made traditional format obsolete
- Proactively redesigned entire unit
- Moved from prevention mindset to strategic design

#### **Key Innovations**

1. **Flipped classroom enhanced** - Chunked lectures + entrepreneur interviews + immediate knowledge checks
2. **Assessment redesign** - From individual, AI-completable work to collaborative, in-class application
3. **Strategic AI use** - Instructor efficiency tool, not student shortcut
4. **Authentic skills** - Students practice entrepreneurship skills (collaboration, real-time problem-solving, presenting under pressure)

#### **Outcomes**

- **Assessment is "AI-proof" by design**, not detection
  - Group work eliminates isolated AI use
  - In-class format requires real-time thinking
  - Oral defense component reveals understanding

- **Students develop authentic capabilities**
  - Collaboration under time pressure
  - Application of concepts to ambiguous problems
  - Negotiating solutions with diverse perspectives
  - Defending reasoning under questioning

- **Instructor efficiency improved**
  - AI handles content generation busywork
  - More time for facilitation and feedback
  - Better variety in scenarios and questions

- **Higher engagement**
  - Active learning replaces passive bibliography compilation
  - Real startup scenarios more relevant than abstract articles
  - Peer interaction increases motivation

#### **Lessons for Other Disciplines**

**When AI makes your assessment completable:**

1. **Don't fight it** - Detection is an arms race you'll lose
2. **Ask:** "What can students NOT do with AI alone?"
3. **Redesign around:**
   - Group collaboration
   - Real-time application
   - In-class demonstration
   - Oral defense/explanation
   - Negotiated consensus

4. **Use AI yourself** - Create better materials faster
5. **Raise the bar** - Authentic tasks are harder, not easier

**Questions to guide redesign:**
- Can this be completed sitting alone with AI?
- Does it require human collaboration?
- Must students demonstrate thinking in real-time?
- Is there negotiation or consensus-building required?
- Would this mirror real workplace challenges?

#### **Connection to Assessment 2030**

Shyam's redesign embodies Assessment 2030 principles:

**50/50 Principle:** 
- 50% can involve AI (quiz prep, scenario research, brainstorming)
- 50% demonstrates individual/group thinking (in-class work, collaboration, defense)

**Demonstration over Prevention:**
- Students can use AI for preparation
- Assessment structure ensures AI reveals, not hides, their capabilities
- Focus on what they DO with information, not just whether they found it

**Authentic Context:**
- Mirrors real entrepreneurship: collaboration under pressure, ambiguous problems, negotiated solutions
- Prepares for workplaces where AI is tool, not crutch

#### **Takeaway for Industry**

This is the same challenge organisations face: When AI can automate individual tasks, value shifts to:
- Collaboration and coordination
- Judgment in ambiguous situations
- Real-time problem-solving
- Negotiating solutions across stakeholders

Shyam's students practice exactly these skills. They graduate prepared for AI-enabled workplaces where tools are powerful but human judgment remains essential.

**Partnership opportunity:** What if the startup scenarios came from your actual business challenges? Students work through real problems, you provide feedback, we create learning experiences grounded in industry reality.

### **Tony's Test Bank Experiment**
**Discipline:** Information Systems  
**Challenge:** Creating revision questions is time-consuming  
**AI Application:** Used AI to generate test bank questions  
**The Twist:** AI got some answers wrong  
**Pedagogical Innovation:** Gave questions to students WITH disclaimer - "Some answers may be wrong. Find them."  
**Outcome:** Transformed error into learning opportunity; students must understand content deeply enough to catch mistakes  
**Key Insight:** AI limitations can be pedagogical features, not just bugs

**Takeaway for Industry:** This models critical evaluation - exactly what employees need when working with AI-generated analysis or recommendations.
