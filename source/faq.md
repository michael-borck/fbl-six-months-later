## Frequently Asked Questions

### **General Questions**

**Q: Is AI going to replace university faculty?**

A: No. The evidence from six months of experimentation shows AI changes faculty work rather than eliminates it. Faculty spend less time on data compilation and more on interpretation, mentoring, and pedagogical design. The work becomes more valuable, not obsolete.

**Q: How much does AI integration actually cost?**

A: It varies widely. Some approaches (using freely available tools like ChatGPT or Claude) have minimal cost. Others (custom tools like FLX Curriculum Curator) require institutional investment. The good news: you can start small with pilots, prove value, then scale. Most faculty experiments described in this presentation used free or existing institutional tools.

### **For Employers & Industry Partners**

**Q: What AI skills should our graduate hires have?**

A: Based on our research and industry feedback, graduates need:
- **Critical evaluation skills** - ability to assess AI outputs for accuracy, bias, limitations
- **Prompt engineering** - knowing how to ask effective questions and structure tasks
- **Domain expertise application** - using their field knowledge to validate and improve AI outputs
- **Ethical judgment** - understanding when AI use is appropriate vs. problematic
- **Integration skills** - incorporating AI into workflows without losing accountability

**Q: How can my organization partner with FBL on AI education?**

A: Several partnership models:
- Provide real-world case studies of AI implementation (successes and failures)
- Offer internships where students work in AI-enabled environments
- Guest lectures on AI transformation in your industry
- Collaborative projects where students solve actual business AI challenges
- Advisory input on curriculum development

**Q: Are Curtin business graduates actually being taught to use AI responsibly?**

A: Yes. Multiple faculty are integrating AI literacy into their units:
- Students learn 5-step frameworks for critiquing AI outputs
- AI conversations are assessed (questions matter more than answers)
- Assessments are designed where AI use reveals rather than hides student thinking
- Ethics and responsible use are embedded in coursework, not just policy documents

### **For Faculty & Educators**

**Q: How do I start experimenting with AI in my teaching?**

A: Start small:
1. Pick one repetitive task (e.g., generating discussion questions, initial draft of feedback)
2. Use AI for first draft, apply your expertise to refine
3. Observe: What worked? What didn't? What surprised you?
4. Share with colleagues (both successes and failures)
5. Iterate

The faculty examples in this presentation all started with small experiments, not grand transformations.

**Q: What if my students use AI to cheat?**

A: Reframe the question: "How do I design assessment where AI use reveals student thinking rather than hides it?"

Examples from our faculty:
- **Tony's approach**: Give AI-generated questions with errors; assess students' ability to find them
- **Renée's approach**: Use AI to enable more ambitious work (graphic novels); assess conceptual understanding
- **Michael's approach**: Mark AI conversations; evaluate question quality and critical evaluation

The Assessment 2030 initiative is developing frameworks for this. See [Assessment Resources](#assessment).

**Q: What's the "5-step framework" mentioned in the presentation?**

A: Framework for teaching students to critique AI responses:
1. **Question the Source** - What's the AI trained on? Known limitations?
2. **Verify Claims** - Cross-check facts, especially statistics and citations
3. **Evaluate Logic** - Does the reasoning actually hold up?
4. **Identify Bias** - What perspectives are missing?
5. **Iterate & Improve** - Use critique to refine your prompts

This teaches active evaluation rather than passive consumption of AI outputs.

**Q: Where can I learn more about using AI in my teaching?**

A: Resources:
- Curtin's Academic Champions program (Microsoft AI training)
- Business AI Research Group (BARG): https://barg.au
- Future of Work Institute (FOWI) resources
- Professional development opportunities through Faculty of Business & Law

### **About Assessment 2030**

**Q: What is Assessment 2030?**

A: A Curtin-wide initiative rethinking assessment design in the AI era. The project explores:
- How to design authentic assessment when AI can generate content
- Moving from "prevention" (stopping AI use) to "demonstration" (showing student thinking)
- The 50/50 principle: At least 50% of assessment should demonstrate individual student thinking
- New assessment formats that use AI as tool rather than threat

**Q: How does this relate to AI in the curriculum?**

A: Assessment design is where AI integration becomes concrete. You can teach with AI, but if your assessment isn't designed for the AI era, students will either avoid AI (and miss developing literacy) or use it inappropriately (bypassing learning).

Assessment 2030 provides frameworks for the middle path: intentional AI use that demonstrates competence.

### **Technical Questions**

**Q: What AI tools are Curtin faculty using?**

A: Most commonly mentioned:
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI) - widely accessible, general purpose
- **Claude** (Anthropic) - preferred by some for nuanced writing tasks
- **Microsoft Copilot** - integrated with Office 365, available through Curtin
- **FLX Curriculum Curator** - custom tool for curriculum development
- **Discipline-specific tools** - various depending on field

**Q: Aren't AI outputs often inaccurate?**

A: Yes - research suggests up to 30% of AI-generated content can contain errors (hallucinations, bias, outdated information). This is precisely why:
1. Domain expertise is essential for quality control
2. We teach students to evaluate critically, not trust blindly
3. AI is best used for focused, bounded tasks with human review
4. Tony's "find the errors" pedagogy is so valuable

The limitations aren't reasons to avoid AI - they're reasons to develop expertise in using it well.
